# MusicInformatics

Different music informatic projects that I worked on in the past including: 

## Music Attributes Similarity Matrices:

Visualizing the data of music attributes to see the similar pattern of that attribute behaving in a song

## Chords Similarity Graph:

Training and Learning the distances between major chords and minor chord so it can be visualized to see how they behaved.

## Song Matching (Audio Fingerprinting):

Matching a segment with noises to a specific song rapidly and correctly in real time.
